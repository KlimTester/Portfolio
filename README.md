## About me

My name is Ilia Klimov, and I am from the vast and beautiful region of Siberia. Although I have a diverse background, one common thread throughout my life has been my unwavering dedication to excellence and my passion for new challenges. I believe these qualities make me a valuable candidate for the role of a Software Tester.

As a professional sportsman and trainer, I have developed my discipline, attention to detail, and the ability to work under pressure. These skills are not only crucial in the world of sports but are also highly applicable to the field of software testing. Just as in sports, precision, focus, and a strong work ethic are vital in ensuring that software functions seamlessly and meets user expectations.

Moreover, my experience in the sports world have taught me the importance of teamwork and effective communication. I understand that successful software testing requires collaboration with various stakeholders to identify and resolve issues efficiently. I am confident that my ability to work well within a team or independently will contribute positively to the software testing process.

Furthermore, I am a naturally positive-thinking person. I believe in the power of optimism to overcome challenges and drive innovation. This positive outlook has served me well in my previous roles and endeavors, and I intend to bring this mindset to the field of software testing to foster a constructive and productive work environment.

In addition to my sports background, I have experience as a logistic employee in an airfreight company at the bustling Airport Schiphol in Amsterdam. This role required me to manage and coordinate the movement of goods efficiently. It enhanced my organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to meet deadlines-qualities that are crucial for quality assurance and software testing.

I am excited about the opportunity to transition into the field of software testing and leverage my unique set of skills and experiences to excel in this role.

# Projects
- [Testing the teacher’s office in the SkyЕng application](https://phrygian-condition-be6.notion.site/Sky-ng-8058d76335444be0b8c5daa580af8644?pvs=4): The “Testing the teacher’s office” project was launched to ensure teachers’ effective work with online -platform. We used a wide range of tools, including automated tests, manual testing and user feedback.

Results include increased stability and performance of the account, identification and elimination of bugs, and improved user experience. Teachers can now interact seamlessly with the platform, facilitating more effective learning and information sharing.
- [Testing the teacher's office API in the SkyЕng application](https://phrygian-condition-be6.notion.site/API-Sky-ng-6c7ad6d8dadb453ebcaab07874072625?pvs=4): The project included testing the functionality of the teacher's office using the API tool Postman. We have created a set of tests covering various aspects of the system, such as logging in, managing classes, adding and grading assignments.

The Postman API tool allowed us to automate the testing process by creating and running requests to the teacher's office API. We used various request methods, checking the correctness of server responses, error handling, and compliance with API documentation.

The testing results made it possible to identify and eliminate various errors and inconsistencies in the functionality of the teacher’s office. This increased system stability, improved user experience, and ensured a more reliable platform.

Overall, the project using the Postman API allowed for effective testing of the teacher's office, improving its functionality and reliability.
