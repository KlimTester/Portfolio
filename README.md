- [✅Testing the teacher's office API in the SkyЕng application](https://phrygian-condition-be6.notion.site/API-Sky-ng-6c7ad6d8dadb453ebcaab07874072625?pvs=4): The project included testing the functionality of the teacher's office using the API tool Postman. We have created a set of tests covering various aspects of the system, such as logging in, managing classes, adding and grading assignments.

The Postman API tool allowed us to automate the testing process by creating and running requests to the teacher's office API. We used various request methods, checking the correctness of server responses, error handling, and compliance with API documentation.

The testing results made it possible to identify and eliminate various errors and inconsistencies in the functionality of the teacher’s office. This increased system stability, improved user experience, and ensured a more reliable platform.

Overall, the project using the Postman API allowed for effective testing of the teacher's office, improving its functionality and reliability.
