## Projects

- [Mobile Testing of the SFERA Mobile application](https://phrygian-condition-be6.notion.site/Sfera-0df488114ce945e79031194b9b5e24fe?pvs=4):
Testing of the SFERA Mobile application SFERA is a mobile application, a digital ecosystem built on the all in one principle, when everything you need is in one place. The basis of the system is the messenger, on the basis of which there are various services. All services and all content in the system are focused on three areas of each person’s life: work, personal life, hobbies. SFERA should help the user develop primarily in offline life. All services and all content will have to fall under three definitions: development, benefit, interests.
- [Testing the Landing Page of the Educational Platform](https://phrygian-condition-be6.notion.site/b208236d4ba14a3a9c2dbf8ca5890116?pvs=4): The Testing Landing Page of the Educational Platform: 
1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. Regression Testing
4. Functional Testing
5. Performance Testing
6. Compatibility Testing
7. Security Testing
8. Mobile Testing
9. Localization Testing
10. Usability Testing
- [Testing the teacher’s office in the SkyЕng application](https://phrygian-condition-be6.notion.site/Sky-ng-8058d76335444be0b8c5daa580af8644?pvs=4): The “Testing the teacher’s office” project was launched to ensure teachers’ effective work with online -platform. We used a wide range of tools, including automated tests, manual testing and user feedback.

Results include increased stability and performance of the account, identification and elimination of bugs, and improved user experience. Teachers can now interact seamlessly with the platform, facilitating more effective learning and information sharing.
- [Testing the teacher's office API in the SkyЕng application](https://phrygian-condition-be6.notion.site/API-Sky-ng-6c7ad6d8dadb453ebcaab07874072625?pvs=4): The project included testing the functionality of the teacher's office using the API tool Postman. We have created a set of tests covering various aspects of the system, such as logging in, managing classes, adding and grading assignments.

The Postman API tool allowed us to automate the testing process by creating and running requests to the teacher's office API. We used various request methods, checking the correctness of server responses, error handling, and compliance with API documentation.

The testing results made it possible to identify and eliminate various errors and inconsistencies in the functionality of the teacher’s office. This increased system stability, improved user experience, and ensured a more reliable platform.

Overall, the project using the Postman API allowed for effective testing of the teacher's office, improving its functionality and reliability.
